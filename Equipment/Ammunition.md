# Ammunition \[[[Changed Rules#Ammunition|Ω]]\]
Ammunition has a type (regular, gel, APDS, etc.) and class of firearm (light pistol, heavy pistol, assault rifle, etc.). For Example, Explosive Heavy Pistol Rounds

An ammunition type’s Damage Modifier and AP Modifier are added to the weapon’s usual DV and AP. For example, an Ares Predator V (DV 8P, AP –1) loaded with explosive rounds (DV +1, AP –1) has a DV of 9P and Armor Penetration of –2.

## APDS Rounds
**Effect:** -4 AP
These are military-grade armor piercing rounds—their full name is armor piercing discarding sabot. They are designed to travel at high velocities and punch through personal body armor. 

## Assault Cannon Rounds
These are for assault cannons only, and they’re the only thing assault cannons can load.

## Explosive Rounds
**Effect:** +1 DV, -1 AP, Special Critical Glitch Effect. 
These slugs carry a shaped-charge explosive, designed to explode and fragment on impact. Explosive rounds misfire whenever you roll a critical glitch. When this happens, you must resist one “attack” with a Damage Value equal to the normal damage done by the weapon (and don’t forget the modifier for the explosive rounds). The attack misses its intended target, and the weapon firing the bullets is destroyed.

## Flechette Rounds
**Effect:** +2 DV, +5 AP.
The payload of a flechette round is made up of tiny, tightly packed metal slivers. The round breaks up and shatters on impact, becoming a tumbling hail of shrapnel. Flechette rounds are devastating against unprotected targets, but not as effective against hardened armor.

## Gel Rounds
**Effect:** Changes damage to Stun, +1 AP, reduce the target’s Physical limit by 2 when checking for [[Special Actions#Knockdown|knockdown]]
These less-lethal rounds use a hard, jelly-like substance that is a safer alternative to rubber bullets. They are often employed for riot control. Their usually semi-rigid slugs flatten on impact, disbursing their kinetic energy over a larger-than-normal area. Gel rounds inflict Stun damage (AP +1). Gel rounds reduce the target’s Physical limit by 2 when checking for [[Special Actions#Knockdown|knockdown]].

## Hollow Point Rounds
**Effect:** +1 DV, +2 AP.
Hollow point rounds have their tips indented, so they are designed to “mushroom” or expand on impact, becoming a hail of deadly fragments not unlike flechettes, although hollow points are a much older technology. Like flechettes, hollow points work better on unarmored targets and tend to flatten against armor.

## Injection Darts
For use with dart guns of various types, like the Parashield pistol and rifle. Each injection dart carries a single dose of a drug or toxin (sold separately). The effect of the dart depends on the drug payload, but to successfully deliver that payload, the attack with the dart must get at least one net hit against an unarmored target or three net hits against a target with armor. This is an injection vector toxin attack.

## Regular Ammo
Also called ball or full metal jacket rounds, these solid slugs are useful for numerous applications (mainly killing things).

## Stick-n-Shock
Stick-n-Shock rounds deal electrical Stun damage of equal to the damage of the base weapon –2. They have a flat AP of –5 that replaces the weapon’s AP instead of stacking with it.

## Tracer Rounds
Tracer ammo burns along the line of flight, making it easier for the shooter to home in on the target. This type of ammunition can only be used in Full Auto weapons and, being loaded as every third round in a clip, is an exception to the restriction of one type of ammunition per clip. They improve the Accuracy of your gun by 1 when you fire more than one round in an Action Phase (cumulative with a laser sight but not a smartgun).

## Taser Darts
These darts are designed to be loaded into taser weapons.
