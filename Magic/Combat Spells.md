# Combat Spells
Combat spells use mana for offensive purposes. They're a magician's weapons and are treated as such.

## Categories
Combat spells are broken up into several categories:
### Direct
Direct damage spells inflict damage on the target directly. Your rolls for these spells translate to the power you are able to channel into the spell vs their natural resistance to that kind of damage.

These spells pit your [[Skills#Spellcasting|Spellcasting]] + [[Attributes#Magic|Magic]] \[[[Magic#Magic Force|Force]]\] against the target's [[Attributes#Body|Body]] or [[Attributes#Willpower|Willpower]], depending on if the spell is of a [[Spellcasting#Physical Spells|Physical]] or [[Spellcasting#Mana Spells|Mana]] type.
The spell deals damage according to the net hits you get on this opposed test. The target does not get to roll to resist damage.
#### Area Spells
If the spell is an area spell, only make one spellcasting roll. Each target inside the area of the spell makes their own roll against the spell.
### Indirect
Indirect damage spells are called into existence near the caster before being launched towards the target. This can be represented however you like. Some mages like to add flair to their casting of these types of spells. Your rolls for these spells translate to your ability to hit the target vs their ability to dodge, and the strength of their armor.
#### Single Target
These spells pit your [[Skills#Spellcasting|Spellcasting]] + [[Attributes#Magic|Magic]] \[[[Magic#Magic Force|Force]]\] against the target's [[Attributes#Reaction|Reaction]] + [[Attributes#Intuition|Intuition]].
The spell deals damage according to the Force of the spell + the net hits on the opposed test, with an [[Armor#Armor Penetration|Armor Penetration]] value equal to the Force of the spell. Damage is resisted with [[Attributes#Body|Body]] + [[Armor#Armor Value|Armor]]. Remember to reduce the armor value by the Armor Penetration of the spell.
#### Area Target
If an indirect spell is an area of effect spell, it detonates on reaching the target area.
This test works like a grenade, being a [[Skills#Spellcasting|Spellcasting]] + [[Attributes#Magic|Magic]] \[[[Magic#Magic Force|Force]]\] (3) test with a scatter of 2D6 Meters. If you beat the threshold, add your net hits to the damage of the spell. Otherwise the hits are used to reduce scatter by 1 meter per hit.
### Elemental
Elemental spells use one of the aforementioned categories to determine their rolls and damage, but deal additional [[Damage#Elemental Damage|Elemental Damage]]. The type of additional damage is listed in the spell entry.
