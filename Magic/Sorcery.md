# Sorcery
Sorcery is one of the branches of magic practiced by Magicians and Mystical Adepts. Sorcery is split into several different skills and practices. Each [[Magic#Magical Traditions|Magical Tradition]] casts spells using the same rules, but may have specific nuances on the wording, hand gestures, etc.
## [[Spellcasting]]
Spellcasting is used to cast spells on the fly with instantaneous effect.
## [[Counterspelling]]
Counterspelling is used to defend against hostile spellcasting and dispel ongoing spells.
## [[Ritual Spellcasting]]
Ritual Spellcasting is used to create magical effects unachievable by regular spellcasting over long periods of time.
