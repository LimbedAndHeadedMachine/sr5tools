# Illusion Spells
Illusion spells distract or confuse enemies, creating mental or visual illusory effects. No matter what the illusion or how realistic, however, they cannot cause actual physical harm.
## Categories
Illusion Spells are broken up into several categories
### Obvious
Obvious illusions are clearly ilusions and cannot be mistaken for reality.
### Realistic
Realistic illusions seem completely real to the target.
### Single-Sense
Single-Sense illusions only affect one of the target's senses.
### Multi-Sense
Multi-Sense illusions affect all of the target's senses.
### Mana Illusions
Mana Illusions affect the mind of targets and are ineffective against technological devices.
These spells pit your [[Skills#Spellcasting|Spellcasting]] + [[Attributes#Magic|Magic]] \[[[Magic#Magic Force|Force]]\] against the target's [[Attributes#Logic|Logic]] + [[Attributes#Willpower|Willpower]].
Some of these spells affect the senses of the target, while others affect the senses of those observing the target. You are never affected by your own spells.
Mana based illusions can be created on the [[The Astral Plane]], but can be discovered as illusions with an [[Skills#Assensing|Assensing]] test. Illusions cannot fool assensing.
### Physical Illusions
Physical illusions create images or affect properties like light and sound. As such they work on technological systems. 
These spells pit your [[Skills#Spellcasting|Spellcasting]] + [[Attributes#Magic|Magic]] \[[[Magic#Magic Force|Force]]\] against a pool according to the type of target.
#### Living Creatures
Living creatures have a dice pool equal to their [[Attributes#Intuition|Intuition]] + [[Attributes#Logic|Logic]].
#### Non-Living Devices
Non-Living Devices have a dice pool equal to their Object Resistance.
## Effect
For illusions involving a contested roll, the caster must get more hits than the target for the illusion to be considered real. If they do, the target is completely affected by the illusion.
