# Ritual Spellcasting
Sorcers can use Ritual Spellcasting to create magical effects that normal [[Spellcasting|spellcasting]] cannot achieve, usually having far greater range or duration. Before you can perform a ritual, you must [[Magic|Learn the ritual]].
## Ritual Characteristics
Every ritual has a set of characteristics that determines how it functions:
### Anchored
Anchored rituals are placed on a physical object or mystical symbol which serves as the focal point of the ritual. This anchor could be something used specifically for the ritual, or could simply be an object of importance. The anchor cannot be moved for the duration of the ritual or the effect will end.
### Material Link
Material Link based rituals require a piece of the intended target to function. 
#### Inanimate Targets
If the target is inanimate, this must be essential to the structure of the object. For example, a brick from the wall of a building would be usable for targeting a building, but a piece of furniture inside of the building would not.
#### Living Targets
If the target is a living thing, the material link must be a tissue sample of some form. However, tissue samples eventually degrade and lose their ability to be used as a material link. Hair, bodily fluids, nail clippings, etc lose their astral connection to the target after a few hours. Larger samples such as flesh carved directly from the target can last several days before being unable to be used.
Freezing material links can sustain them for longer, to your gamemaster's discretion, but using chemical preservation will immediately make them unsuitable for use in rituals.
### Minion
Minion rituals create semi-autonomous entities, usually to serve the one who makes it. Minions created in this was are bound to the ritual leader, and you cannot have more minions than your [[Attributes#Charisma|Charisma]] rating.
### Spell
Spell based rituals are used in tandem with a spell known to the leader of the ritual, sometimes modifying it's properties. The ritual description will note what modifications are made, if any. Any modifiers to a spell given by the leader's [[Magic#Mentor Spirits|Mentor Spirit]] apply to a ritual using the spell. Spell based rituals can be [[Counterspelling#Dispelling Rituals|Dispelled]].
### Spotter
Spotter based rituals are unique in that they allow one of the ritual's participants to leave the ritual to gain or maintain line of sight to a target, known as a spotter. The spotter must be a member of the group casting the ritual or a spirit bound to one of the members of the group, and must be able to [[The Astral Plane#Astral Perception|Astraly Perceive]] the target.
The spotter must be present at the ritual's foundation when it begins and then travel, physically or astraly, to where the target is and be able to [[Skills#Assensing|Assense]] them.
While the ritual is being performed, there is a link formed between the spotter and the rest of the ritual group. This link could potentially be used to find the physical location of the ritual.
Spotters do not make Teamwork Tests as part of the ritual, but still suffers [[Magic#Magical Drain|drain]].
## Performing a ritual
Ritual spellcasting can be broken up into several steps:
### 1. Choose the Ritual Leader
Choose someone to lead the ritual. The leader must know the ritual being performed so they can complete the last step, and must know the spell being cast if the ritual has the [[Ritual Spellcasting#Spell|Spell]] keyword. All other participants simply need to be willing to take part, but suffer a -2 dice pool penalty for all actions involving the ritual if they are not of the same tradition as the leader. The ritual only carries the [[The Astral Plane#Astral Signatures|Astral Signature]] of the leader.
### 2. Choose the Ritual
Choose the ritual that will be performed. This is done by the leader, as is choosing the spell involved if necessary.
### 3. Choose the Ritual Force
Choose the force of the ritual. Higher force rituals incur more [[Magic#Magical Drain|drain]] on the participants.
### 4. Create the Foundation
Rituals must be performed in a magical lodge of the same tradition as the leader. This lodge is called the **foundation** of the ritual. The force of the lodge must be equal to or greater than the force of the ritual being cast. Once the foundation is formed in this step, nobody except a [[Ritual Spellcasting#Spotter|Spotter]] can leave without the ritual failing.
### 5. Give the Offering
Expend reagents equal to the force of the ritual. This step is done by the leader.
### 6. Perform the Ritual
Perform the ritual according to the description. The duration is listed in the description of the ritual.
### 7. Seal the Ritual
Seal the ritual to complete the effects. The ritual leader makes a [[Skills#Ritual Spellcasting|Ritual Spellcasting]] + [[Attributes#Magic|Magic]] \[[[Magic#Magic Force|Force]]\] ([[Magic#Magic Force|Force]] \* 2) test, with a Teamwork Test from all of the participants. The net hits on this test determine the effectiveness of the ritual, according to the ritual description.
Each participant takes [[Magic#Magical Drain|drain]] equal to the number of hits on the Teamwork test \* 2. If the number of hits on the teamwork test is greater than the leader's [[Attributes#Magic|Magic]] rating, the drain is physical damage. Otherwise it is stun damage.
The leader can expend reagents during this step to reduce the drain of the ritual. For each dram of Reagents spent, the drain is reduced by one point, to a minimum of two.
## Ritual Failure
A number of things could cause a ritual to fail. A participant could leave during the ritual, the leader could be incapacitated ot killed, or perhaps the foundation could be broken. If a ritual fails, the participants immediately suffer drain equal to the hits on a dice pool with a size equal to the force of the ritual \* 2. All reagents spent are wasted.
## Glitches
Glitches in any part of the ritual could have ill effects on the ritual. Examples include a +2 drain value, +2 to the threshhold to seal the ritual, or perhaps the leader having to seal the ritual alone. On a critical glitch, anything goes. Perhaps the minion being created becomes hostile, or the ritual affects an unintended target. The gamemaster is given liscense to be as sadistic as they please.
