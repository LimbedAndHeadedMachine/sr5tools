## Types of Magic
Magic is split into several different types. Different magic types can be used by different awakened invidividuals.
There are 4 main categories of magic.
[[Sorcery]], Using mana to cast spells and perform magic rituals.
[[Enchantment]], Using mana to imbue objects with magical power.
[[Conjuring]], Summoning spirits and binding them to your service.
[[Adepts]], Channeling mana into your body to enhance it's abilities.

## Learning Spells
Spells can be learned in one of two ways:
- Being taught by someone, like a teacher.
- Using a spell formula and learning on your own.

Either way, you require access to a [[Magical Lodges|Magical Lodge]] of your [[Magical Traditions|Tradition]].
With access to both a method of learning and a magical lodge available, make a learning test of [[Attributes#Intuition|Intuition]] + [[Skills#Spellcasting|Spellcasting]], [[Skills#Alchemy|Alchemy]], or [[Skills#Ritual Spellcasting|Ritual Spellcasting]] with a limit equal to your magical lodge's force.  
You take all modifiers to this test including injuries, environmental effects, sustained spells, etc. There is an additional -4 dice pool modifier to learning the spell if the formula or tradition is of another tradition than your own.  
Learning the spell takes 12 / the number of hits in days, with each day requiring 8 hours to be dedicated to learning the spell. If you do not maintain this 8 hour requirement over the duration, you fail to learn the spell and must try again.
