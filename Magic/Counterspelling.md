# Counterspelling
Sorcerers can use counterspelling to defend themselves and their allies against an enemy sorcerer's spells, and dispel sustained spell effects. Note that counterspelling does not affect spirits, critters, or spells woven into alchemical preparations.
## Spell Defense
Spell defense allows a sorcerer to protect themselves and their allies against hostile spells cast at them. You must have line of sight to the person you want to protect in this way, using the same rules as when [[Spellcasting#Line Of Sight|spellcasting]].
Declaring that you are using spell defense is a Free Action. If you do not have a Free Action left you can alternatively use an Interrupt Action, reducing your Initiative by five points.
You have a dice pool for spell defense equal to your [[Skills#Counterspelling|Counterspelling]] skill rating. You can choose to use any number of your counterspelling dice to defend against the incoming spell, and can protect a number of people, including yourself, up to your magic rating.
Each person you are protecting adds the number of counterspelling dice you are expending to their defense test against the spell. As long as you have counterspelling dice left, you can keep defending against spells in this way.
Your counterspelling dice are recovered at the end of each combat Turn.
## Dispelling
Dispelling allows a sorcerer to interrupt a sustained or quickened spell, or certain rituals.
### Dispelling Sustained or Quickened Spells
Dispelling pits your [[Skills#Counterspelling|Counterspelling]] + [[Attributes#Magic|Magic]] \[[[Attributes#Astral|Astral]]\] against the [[Magic#Magic Force|Force]] of the spell + the caster's [[Attributes#Magic|Magic]] + the Karma spent on quickening the spell, if any.
You can spend Reagents to change the limit of the test, with the new limit becoming the number of drams of reagents spent.
Each net hit on the opposed test reduces the hits of the spell by one. If the spell is reduced to 0 hits, it ends.
Dispelling a spell, successful or not, incurs [[Magic#Magical Drain|Drain]] as if you had cast it.
### Dispelling Rituals
A ritual can be dispelled if it contains the **Spell** keyword and is sustained or has a duration. Dispelling a ritual pits your  [[Skills#Counterspelling|Counterspelling]] + [[Attributes#Magic|Magic]] \[[[Attributes#Astral|Astral]]\] against a dice pool equal to the [[Magic#Magic Force|Force]] of the spell + the sum of all of the [[Attributes#Magic|Magic]] ratings of the participants of the ritual.
Every net hit reduces the net hits of the ritual's sealing step by one. Dispelling a ritual incurs [[Magic#Magical Drain|Drain]] equal to twice the hits you got on the opposing test. If the [[Magic#Magic Force|Force]] of the ritual is greater than your [[Attributes#Magic|Magic]] rating, the drain is physical damage. Otherwise it is stun damage.
