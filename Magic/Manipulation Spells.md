# Manipulation Spells
Manipulation spells are used to animate, transform, and control various forms of matter and energy.

## Categories
Manipulation spells are broken up into several categories.
### Damaging
Damaging manipulation spells deal damage equal to the force of the spell. The target can resist the damage with [[Attributes#Body|Body]] + [[Armor#Armor Rating|Armor]]. The damage has 0 [[Armor#Armor Penetration|Armor Penetration]] and you do not add the hits on your spellcasting roll to the damage.
### Mental
Mental manipulation spells affect the mind of the target. These spells pit your [[Skills#Spellcasting|Spellcasting]] + [[Attributes#Magic|Magic]] against the target's [[Attributes#Logic|Logic]] + [[Attributes#Willpower|Willpower]]. Your net hits determine how many combat turns you can sustain the spell for. 
The target can make a [[Attributes#Logic|Logic]] + [[Attributes#Willpower|Willpower]] test on each of their turns to reduce the duration of the spell. The target takes a dice pool penalty equal to the [[Magic#Magic Force|Force]] of the spell on this test, but each hit they get reduces the number of turns the caster can sustain the spell for by one. The target can take this action even if they wouldn't get an action because of the spell.
When the number of turns you can sustain the spell is reduced to 0, the spell ends.

The target of a mental manipulation spell can make a [[Magic#Perceiving Magic|Perceiving Magic]] test to notice the effects of the spell if they are not obvious.
### Environmental
Environmental manipulation spells don't have a target, they just affect an area according to their spell description.
### Physical
Physical manipulation spells affect physical forms. These spells pit your [[Skills#Spellcasting|Spellcasting]] + [[Attributes#Magic|Magic]] \[[[Magic#Magic Force|Force]]\] against a pool according to the type of target.
#### Living Creatures
Living creatures have a dice pool equal to their [[Attributes#Body|Body]] + [[Attributes#Strength|Strength]].
#### Non-Living Objects
Non-Living objects have a dice pool equal to their Object Resistance.
