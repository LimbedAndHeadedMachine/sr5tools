# Spellcasting
Sorcerers can use mana to cast spells, channeling it into a physical or astral form.  
Before you can cast a spell, you must [[Learning Spells|Learn the spell]].

## Spell Characteristics
Every spell has a set of characteristics that determines how it functions:
### Type:
Type is broken into physical or mana. 
#### Physical Spells 
Physical spells convert mana into effects in the real world. This might take the form of  energy like fireballs and lightning, or matter like ice sheets and physical barriers. This energy or matter is converted back into mana when the spell ends. Physical spells can target both living beings or non-living objects.
#### Mana Spells 
Mana spells use mana directly to affect astral forms or other things with auras. Mana spells can affect forms on both physical and astral planes if you are on the same plane. Only mana spells can affect astral forms.

### Range:
Range determines the requirements for targeting a given spell.
#### Line Of Sight
A target type of LOS requires having line of sight to the target. This line of sight can be established through reflections or transparent materials, but must be made with your own eyesight. Cyber or bioware that was paid for with essence counts for this requirement, but a camera feed would not as you are seeing a generated image.

Astral sight can be used to target astral forms if you are [[The Astral Plane#Astral Perception|astrally perceiving]] or are [[The Astral Plane#Astral Projection|astral projecting]]. If you are in astral space, you can only target [[The Astral Plane#Astral Forms|astral forms]], and vice versa in physical space. If you are [[Powers#Dual Natured|dual natured]] then you can target forms in both physical and astral space.
#### Line Of Sight (Area)
A target type of LOS(A) works like LOS but affects an area. This area has a radius equal to the [[Magic#Magic Force|force]] of the spell in meters.
 #### Touch
 A target type of T requires you to be touching the target. If the target is unwilling, this might require an unarmed attack to make contact. Skin contact is not required, armor or clothing will work as well.
 
 ### Damage:
 Spells can inflict either Physical (P) or Stun (S) damage. The damage type inflicted by a spell is listed in it's entry. This damage fills up it's respective damage tracker.
 
 ### Duration:
 Each spell has a different duration.
 #### Instantaneous
 I spells take effect immediately and then fade immediately. Plain and simple.
 #### Sustained
 S spells take effect immediately and last as long as they are sustained. Sustaining spells incurs a -2 penalty to all of your dice pools. This penalty stacks for each spell being sustained.
 
 Area of effect spells that are being sustained can be moved as a complex action. Any new targets entering the area of effect must defend against the effects immediately. Conversely, targets leaving are no longer affected by the spell.
 #### Permanent
 P spells work like S spells, except that their effect becomes permanent after being sustained for *force* combat turns.
 
 ### Drain:
 Each spell has a formula used to calculate it's [[Magic#Magical Drain|drain]] value. This value can never be reduced below 2.
 
 ### Spell Categories:
 Each spell has a category it fits into which affects how it works.
 - [[Combat Spells]]
 - [[Detection Spells]]
 - [[Health Spells]]
 - [[Illusion Spells]]
 - [[Manipulation Spells]]

## Casting A Spell
Spellcasting can be broken up into the following steps:

### 1. Choose a Spell
Choose a spell to cast. The spell must be one that you know, and you must have learned it as a spellcasting spell.

You can cast several spells simultaneously, as part of the same action. Split your dice pool for spellcasting between all of the spells you are casting. Your dice pool cannot go below 1 die for any of these spells. Any modifiers to the dice pools are applied after splitting them.

### 2. Choose The Target
Choose the target or targets of the spell(s). Depending on the spell, you might need to meet certain requirements for targeting, such as having line of sight or touching the target. The details will be on the spell page, marked as T, LOS, or LOS(A).

### 3. Choose The Spell Force
Choose the force for the spell or spells. Higher force spells incur more drain on the caster. You cannot cast a spell with a force greater than your magic rating x 2.
If the number of hits you get after applying your limit is greater than your magic rating, the drain is physical.

### 4. Cast The Spell
Casting a spell is a complex action by default. You can instead cast the spell(s) as a simple action by using *reckless casting*, applying +3 drain to *each* spell cast as part of this action.

Make a [[Skills#Spellcasting|Spellcasting]] + [[Attributes#Magic|Magic]] test, with a limit of the force of the spell. Apply any modifiers including wounds, sustained spells, and environment.

### 5. Determine The Spell Effects
Determine the effect of the spell(s), as listed in the desciption of the spell. Some spells require the target to contest it's effect, or have different effects as determined by the number of hits rolled when casting the spell. Refer to the spell's page for details.

This step precedes rolling for drain. The spell will take effect even if drain knocks you unconscious.

### 6. Resist Drain
Calculate the drain of the spell or spells cast according to it's [[#Drain|drain formula]].
Roll the dice pool your [[Magical Traditions|magic tradition]] uses to resist drain. Each hit scored reduces the drain from the spell by 1 point. Apply any leftover drain as either stun or physical damage accordingly.


## Glitches When Casting Spells
Glitches when casting a spell should be treated the same as a glitch in any other kind of test. Perhaps the drain value increases or the effect isn't quite what you intended. It's up to your gamemaster to determine what happens. If the drain is being increased by the glitch, a typical value to use would be +2.
