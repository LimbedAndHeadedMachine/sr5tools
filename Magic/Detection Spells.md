# Detection Spells
Detection spells are used to give the target a new sense, or modify their existing senses. They can be cast on yourself or another target, usually within touch range. These spells are almost always sustained, granting their benefits to the target as long as the caster sustains them.
## Range
Detection spells have a range equal to the [[Magic#Magic Force|Force]] of the spell \* the caster's [[Attributes#Magic|Magic rating]] in meters. Some detection spells have a separate "Extended" version that has a range equal to the Force of the spell \* the caster's Magic rating \* 10 in meters.
## Categories
Detection spells are split into active and passive spells.
### Passive
Passive spells do not require the target to use a separate action in order to use the new sense. The target may still need to perform skill rolls depending on what they are trying to do with the sense. Tests made using a sense added by a passive detection spell have a limit equal to the net hits on the spellcasting roll. For example, giving a target astral sight would not require the target to use an action to see the astral world, but a perception check may still be required to spot something in particular.

Counterspelling cannot help defend against passive senses gained in this way, but the spell can still be [[Sorcery#Dispelling|Dispelled]].

### Active
Active spells require an action to use the new sense. These spells pit your [[Skills#Spellcasting|Spellcasting]] + [[Attributes#Magic|Magic]] \[[[Magic#Magic Force|Force]]\] against a pool according to the type of target.
#### Living Things With Auras
Living things that have auras use their [[Attributes#Willpower|Willpower]] + [[Attributes#Logic|Logic]] \[[[Attributes#Mental|Mental]]\]. If the target can use counterspelling, add it to their dice pool as well. This applies even if the target is unaware of the spell.
#### Magical Objects
Magical objects have a dice pool equal to their [[Magic#Magic Force|Force]] \* 2.
#### Mundane Objects
Mundane objects have a dice pool equal to their object resistance.
#### Area Spells
If the spell is an area spell, only make one spellcasting roll. Each target makes their own resistance roll as part of the opposed test. New targets entering the area of the spell make their resistance rolls when entering the area.
## Spell Effect
Some detection spells give more detailed information the more net hits you get on your roll. This is usually noted in the entry for the spell, but is also subject to the gamemaster's discretion.
## Spell Glitches
Glitches can occur in spellcasting like any other roll. They can have various effects as noted in [[Spellcasting#Glitches When Casting Spells|Glitches When Casting Spells]].
In addition to those effects, detection spells might give incorrect or incomplete information, strip the target of a sense, or give an *unintended* target the effects of the spell, particular opponents.
