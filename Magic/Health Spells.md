# Health Spells
Health spells are used to heal injury, cure diseases, and modify and enhance the functions of the body. Health spells cannot heal stun damage or cure psychological conditions. Additionally,  ***Health spells cannot be used to heal damage taken through drain.***

Health Spells always require physically touching the target of the spell. Targets who have lost some of their essence through augmentations or other means can be harder to affect with health spells. Spells with the [[Attributes#Essence|Essence]] tag in their entry take a penalty to their dice pool equal to the missing essence of the target.

Most Health Spells take a simple [[Skills#Spellcasting|Spellcasting]] + [[Attributes#Magic|Magic]] \[[[Magic#Magic Force|Force]]\] test. Certain spells are exceptions to this rule, and the test will be listed in the spell's description.
