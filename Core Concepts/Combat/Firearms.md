# Firearms 
Firearms come in a variety of shapes and sizes but they all do pretty much the same thing: throw high-velocity projectiles designed to damage whatever they hit. Whether this is spraying lead downrange or firing a single high-precision shot, the results can be deadly. Which, generally, is the plan.

## Firing Modes \[[[Changed Rules#Firing Modes|Ω]]\]
The first thing we need to look at when it comes to firearms is the firing mode. A weapon’s firing mode determines how quickly each round is ready to fire, how quickly you can pull the trigger, and what happens when you do. Each mode description includes a few examples so that a gamemaster can assess and classify any weapon not included in the descriptions below or the Street Gear chapter.

### Single Shot (SS)
Firing a Single Shot (SS) weapon uses a Simple Action that cannot be combined with any other attacking Simple Action in the same Action Phase. SS weapons can take advantage of the [[Special Actions#Multiple Attacks|Multiple Attacks]] Free Action if the attacker is wielding two such weapons. Single Shot weapons include bolt-action rifles, single-action revolvers, pump-action shotguns, lever-action rifles, and some large weapons that need extra time to chamber a fresh round due to the cartridge’s size. Single Shot fire assumes another round is readied with each shot as long as rounds are available in the gun.

### Semi-Automatic (SA)
Semi-automatic weapons fire a round every time the trigger is pulled and automatically chamber a fresh round after each shot. Semi-Automatic weapons fire a single round with a Simple Action or a burst of three rounds with a Complex Action. With more shots going downrange they increase the chance that a bullet will hit. Semi-automatic weapons can take advantage of the [[Special Actions#Multiple Attacks|Multiple Attacks]] Free Action if the shooter has two semi-automatic weapons or is firing a burst. 

See [[#Firing Mode Table]] for attack information.

### Burst Fire (BF)
Burst Fire (BF) weapons are usually SMGs or assault rifles, but some pistols and shotguns can be modified for this mode. In burst-fire mode a gun rapidly fires three bullets every time the trigger is pulled as a Simple Action. or two three-round bursts in rapid succession as a Complex Action. Burst Fire weapons can take advantage of the [[Special Actions#Multiple Attacks|Multiple Attacks]] Free Action to fire at multiple targets with the same burst.  

See [[#Firing Mode Table]] for attack information.

### Full Auto (FA)
Weapons that can fire in Full-Auto (FA) mode can throw bullets for as long as the attacker keeps the trigger pulled and the rounds last. Full-Auto weapons can be fired as a Simple Action, firing 6 bullets, or a Complex Action, firing 10 bullets. Full-auto weapons can take advantage of the [[Special Actions#Multiple Attacks|Multiple Attacks]] Free Action to fire at multiple targets with the same burst.  

See [[#Firing Mode Table]] for attack information.

### Suppressive Fire

## Shotguns
Shotguns fire slug rounds. Characters can load them with shot rounds, but shot rounds have little effect against 21st-century body armor. To determine the damage done by shot rounds, apply the [[Equipment/Ammunition#Flechette Rounds|flechette ammunition]] rules. Shot rounds spread when fired, creating a cone of shot extending outward from the shotgun’s muzzle. This allows the shot to hit multiple targets, but with reduced effectiveness due to the spread of the shot pellets over a wider area. The mechanism that controls this spread is called the choke. The shotgun user can set his weapon’s choke for a narrow spread, medium spread, or wide spread. Changing the choke setting requires a Simple Action (or a Free Action if the shotgun is smartlinked).

### Choke Settings
Medium and Wide spreads cannot be used with Called Shots.

#### Narrow Spread
The target gets –1 dice pool modifier for defense at all ranges.

#### Medium Spread

**At short range**, you get –1 DV, targets get –3 defense, and up to two targets within a 2-meter spread can be targeted using the same roll. 
**At medium range**, you get –3 DV, targets get –3 defense, and up to three targets within a 4-meter spread can be targeted using the same roll. 
**At long range**, you get –5 DV, –1 Accuracy, targets get –3 defense, and up to four targets within a 6-meter spread can be targeted using the same roll. 
**At extreme range**, you get –7 DV, –1 Accuracy, targets get –3 defense, and up to six targets within a 8-meter spread can be targeted using the same roll. 

#### WIde Spread
**At short range**, you get –3 DV, targets get –5 defense, and up to two targets within a 3-meter spread can be targeted using the same roll. 
**At medium range**, you get –5 DV, targets get –5 defense, and up to three targets within a 6-meter spread can be targeted using the same roll. 
**At long range**, you get –7 DV, –1 Accuracy, targets get –5 defense, and up to four targets within a 9-meter spread can be targeted using the same roll. 
**At extreme range**, you get –9 DV, –1 Accuracy, targets get –5 defense, and up to six targets within a 12-meter spread can be targeted using the same roll.
