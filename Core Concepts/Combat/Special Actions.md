# Knockdown
Characters who take damage may be knocked down by the attack or its staggering effects. If a character takes a number of boxes of damage (Stun or Physical, after a Damage Resistance Test) from a single attack that exceed his Physical limit, then the attack automatically knocks him down (this acts as a forced, free Drop Prone action). Any character who takes 10 or more boxes of damage after a Resistance Test in a single attack is always knocked down. 
Certain less-than-lethal weapons are specifically designed to knock a target down. Gel rounds, for example, reduce the Physical limit of a character by 2 when comparing it to the DV to determine knockdown. 
A character making a melee attack may attempt to intentionally knock his opponent to the ground by using [[#Called Shots]].

# Multiple Attacks
Characters sometimes want to really put on the hurting in a single Action Phase and can choose to attack more than once in a single Action Phase by using the Multiple Attacks Free Action. This action represents both attacking multiple times from a single melee weapon and attacking with two different weapons (firearms or melee). The attacker’s dice pool is calculated with all modifiers (Wound, Environmental, Situational, and the full recoil of all attacks if it’s a ranged attack) and then split as evenly as possible between all attacks, and each attack is handled separately. (Keep in mind as the dice pool gets smaller the chances of a glitch rise.) 
Dice gained by spending Edge applies before the pool is split, while dice from both pools can be re-rolled with a single use of Edge. 
The total number of attacks you can make in a single Action Phase is limited to one-half the attacker’s Combat Skill.
