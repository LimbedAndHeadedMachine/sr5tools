Ammunition is defined by type (regular, gel, APDS, etc.), class of firearm (light pistol, heavy pistol, assault rifle, etc.) and as cased or caseless. Unless indicated otherwise in its description, a gun can fire cased or caseless ammo, but not both. For simplicity, each kind of gun can trade ammo with another of its class: for example, all heavy pistols can share ammo.  

An ammunition type’s Damage Modifier and AP Modifier are added to the weapon’s usual DV and AP. For example, an Ares Predator V (DV 8P, AP –1) loaded with explosive rounds (DV +1, AP –1) has a DV of 9P and Armor Penetration of –2.
